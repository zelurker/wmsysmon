You have downloaded wmsysmon, a small dock application for use with
WindowMaker (www.windowmaker.org) to show system information on interrupt
activity, memory use, swap use, and IO.  wmsysmon was originally written by
Dave Clark, I saw room for improvement in wmsysmon and sent some updates in
to Dave Clark, after nearly a month went by with no response I decided to
takeover development.  Dave Clark is OK with this, it appears he is
too overworked to keep up with everything, if you are management over Dave
Clark give him a break :).  This program is licensed under the GNU GPL, see
file COPYING.

Simply enter the 'src' directory and type 'make' to build wmsysmon, if you are
using a SMP x86 machine or an alpha machine you may want to edit the Makefile
and uncomment -DHI_INTS before building, this enables monitoring the 24
interrupts available on such machines.  After building successfully, execute
'make install' to install the binary into /usr/local/bin, root will be required
to write the binary in /usr/local/bin, but it is not required to install the
binary in /usr/local/bin to use wmsysmon, it may be run from anywhere in
the filesystem, but on a multi-user system it is preferred to have it available
for everyone to use, hence /usr/local/bin.

For information on running wmsysmon, execute 'wmsysmon -h' after building (and
installing) using the above instructions.

Cheers.
